tesseract-vs2012
================

Tesseract OCR engine and dependencies with VS 2012 support, both 64 and 32 bit.

This repository contains the from Google's [Tesseract OCR project](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) for tesseract 3.02 and leptonica 1.68, along with dependencies for everything but GIF support.

What is not included is the VS 2008 build system.


Currently only liblept168.dll, libtesseract302.dll and tesseract.exe are built. You'll need to use the original distribution for training purposes.
